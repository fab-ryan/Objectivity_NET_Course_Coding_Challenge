this repo that contains Objectivity  .NET Course Coding Challenge. the implementation was done in Typescript and JavaScript. 

# Array Change

Array Change is Challenge that implement the functionality that take two array and return them but seperately where one return add value and other include removed value.

### How to run test

Since `js File` is touched on this branch and must have the 
`nodeJS` installed just run:
- `node arrayChange/`
 or first compile ts file to js by running 
 - `tsc` then run previous commands:
 - `node arrayChange/`
  but first of all typescript compiler should be installed.

### Example

```
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const updatedArray = [2, 3, 4];

```

### Out put should be:

`newElements as new element`

`removedElements as removed element`

in other word this should be out but
```
New Element [ 4 ] 

Removed Element [ 1 ]
```
